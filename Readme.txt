This is the README.txt for version 3.0

This is an UNSTABLE release of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras,
which contains new, untested or lightly tested code and will expire.

There is a STABLE release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

This is the second release of the ICamera2/ASCOM 6 version of the sxASCOM
driver. In order to use this version of the driver you will have to upgrade
your ASCOM platform to version 6.

This version adds:
    - support for the 2012 SX cameras (674/694/Superstar)
    - a bunch of quality enhancments for the lodestar
    - "fixed binning", which lets you set a bin mode from the 
       configuration screen for software that doesn't support
       binning

With the exception of the Bayer matrix informational features (which needs 
a firmware tweak from Starlight Xpress to fully implement) I belive this is 
a complete ICamera2/ASCOM 6 implementation (and the ASCOM 6 conform agrees).

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

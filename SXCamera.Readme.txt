This is the README.txt for version 5.5.1

I have changed my version numbering scheme - this is the the versino that 
would have been 2.3 before.  The first two numbers now indicate the miniumum
version of ASCOM that must be installed.

This is a Release Candidate build of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras.
It contains code which has been tested and is believed to be of
production quality. 

It will be promoted to be a PRODUCTION release once I have ASCOM conform tool
output for a number of the cameras that it supports.  If you are running a 
camera which is not yet listed as having a conform report, please volunteer 
to run conform on the yahoo group.

This version adds:
    - an option to wait to begin an exposure until the CCD temperature
        is at the desired set point
    - an option to control when the driver switches from using internal
        timing to external timing
    - M26C support
    - Changes M26C and H35 from untested to tested
    - Fixed a problem with FullWellDepth property
    - More frequent flushing for long exposures
    - the driver is now build with MSVS 2010

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

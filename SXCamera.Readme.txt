This is the README.txt for version 2.1.1.2

This is an UNSTABLE release of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras,
which contains new, untested or lightly tested code and will expire.

There is a STABLE release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

This version adds:
    - support for CoStar
    - support for up to 8 cameras 
        (2xImaging, 2xLodestar, 2xCostar, 2xGuider)
    - a complete rewrite of the pixel processing code, resulting in measured
        speedups of up to 30X (on my machine lodestar processing dropped
        from 120ms/frame to 4ms/frame)

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

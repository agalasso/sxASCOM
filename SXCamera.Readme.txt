This is release candidate 1 for the sxASCOM driver. I am a little hesitant
because I have not had a chance to test it under the stars.  Since the current
Beta version was going to expire I had to at the very least reabuild it.

This version is a Release version, which means that some debugging code
is not included and by default logging is not enabled.  Please turn 
logging on before you run tests.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until 
you have tried it during the daylight first.

This code seems to be approaching production quality for interlaced
cameras and the SXF guider.  If you have one of the tested progressive 
cameras (M25C/H9/H9C) you should have good luck. 

Full screen, unbinned images with interlaced cameras worked in the
last release. This release aims to improve support for binned and sub-images
for interlaced cameras. At best the are Alpha quality.

If you have an interlaced camera, including Lodestar, please test it.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until 
you have tried it during the daylight first.

There is experimental support for SXVR camera coolers.  Because I cannot test the cooler code (since my camera is an SXVF 
model), cooler support is disabled by default.  If you would like to try cooler support, make sure that you have selected
the "Enable untested Cameras/Features" checkbox.

This code is an Release Candidate.  That means that it needs a bit more
testing before being released, but there are currently no known issues
when the "Enable untested Cameras/Features" checkbox is not selected.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until you have
tried it during the daylight first. 

If you are willing to help by loading the driver, and 
seeing if it works with your camera and guider (if you have one), I'd 
like to know the results. If it doesn't work, it can create a log file 
which might help me fix it.

How can you help?

What is really needed is testing on a broad range of SX cameras.  Please try the driver with your camera.  If it 
seems to work, please send me a email letting me know what model camera you have. If you really want to help, please
download the ASCOM confomance tester from http://ascom-standards.org/Downloads/DevTools.htm, run it with your 
camera connected, and send me the output.

If your camera doesn't seem to work correctly, please check the "Enable Logging" option on the properties page.  
This will create a file named ascom-sx-camera.log on your desktop.  Email me this file along with your 
camera model.

This code seems to be approaching production quality for interlaced
cameras and the SXF guider.  If you have one of the tested progressive 
cameras (M25C/H9/H9C) you should have good luck. 

Full screen, unbinned images with progressive cameras did not work in the
last release.  At best the are Alpha quality.

This release tries to improve support for interlaced cameras, but I'm unable 
to test it myself because I don't have one.  

In the previous version full screen, 2x2 binned interlaced images seemed to 
work.  This release attempts to get the beginnings of other binning
settings to work - it is likely that only binning that the
the resolution of the sensor can be divided by will work (i.e. if you want 
to bin by 3, the size of the sensor probably needs to be divisible by 3). 
For lodestar, this means only 2X bining.

If you have an interlaced camera, including Lodestar, please test it.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until 
you have tried it during the daylight first. 

What's changed for Version 1.3.10:
    Fix a problem with interlaced stitching (2011-02-01 00:28:40 -0700 by Bret McKee <bretm@boneheads.us>)

This is the README for the ASCOM driver for Starlight Express cameras.

     This driver was not written by, authorized by, sanctioned by, or any
     other ... by Starlight Express.  It was independently developed 
     from the developer documentation available from the SX website. I had
     a couple of email exchanges with Terry Platt, but that is the extent
     of SX involvement.  Please do not make them regret providing 
     developer documentation by asking questions or complaining about 
     problems to SX.

I am moving from DSLR imaging to CCD imaging, and am a professional software 
developer. I discovered that my two favorite imaging apps (PHD and
Images Plus) would not work with my new SX camera.  I also had some truely
lousy weather, and since it was a "simple matter of programming" to make them
work with my camera, I wrote this driver.

This is an BETA release.  That means it isn't quite ready for prime time.  I'm 
releasing it in the hopes of learning more about how it works with various
SX cameras and guiders. 

I have acquired several night's worth of images with it, with PHD taking
a guider exposure every 2 seconds and the main camera taking 4 minutes 
exposures.  I've not seen any crash issues for some time. 

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until you have
tried it during the daylight first. 

I have am SXVF-M25C and the older style 8 bit guide camera, and I managed to 
borrow a friend's SXF-H9c.  It seems to work with all of them. 

If you are willing to help by loading the driver, and 
seeing if it works with your camera and guider (if you have one), I'd 
like to know the results. If it doesn't work, it can create a log file 
which might help me fix it.

Expected To Work:
- SXVF-MX25C
- SXF-H9C
- SX 8-bit Guide Camera
- Simultanious use of both cameras by seperate software products
- Autoguider port - if a guide camera is attached, the guide port shows up
  as attached to it.  If not, it is attached to the main camera.

Will probably work:
- other SX cameras
- SX 16 bit guide camera

Known Limitations/things that don't work:

- There is no support for SXVR cooler features since I don't have a camera
  which provides these features, and because there is no documentation for 
  those features on the SX website
- serial ports - I don't have the serial box, and if I did it would require 
  writing virtual serial drivers for my telescope to take advantage of them

How can you help?

What is really needed is testing on a broad range of SX cameras.  Please try the driver with your camera.  If it 
seems to work, please send me a email letting me know what model camera you have. If you really want to help, please
download the ASCOM confomance tester from http://ascom-standards.org/Downloads/DevTools.htm, run it with your 
camera connected, and send me the output.

If your camera doesn't seem to work correctly, please check the "Enable Logging" option on the properties page.  
This will create a file named ascom-sx-camera.log on your desktop.  Email me this file along with your 
camera model.

Disclaimer:

In the interest of full disclosure, I want to make something perfectly
clear.  I'm a hobbiest, and I'd rather be imaging than writing software. 

Assuming I get the driver working well enough that I can use it for my imaging
needs, any other work I do on it will be taking time away from some other part
of my life.  

I hope to get the driver working for a broad range of cameras,
but supporting cameras that I don't own and can't test on will be a non-trivial 
undertaking.  If doing so turns out to take a huge amount of time, I might 
abandon the effort or request donations. If that would offend you, please don't use 
this software.

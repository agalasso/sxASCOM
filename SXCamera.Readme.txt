This is the README.txt for version 1.5.1, the first non-test version for the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress
cameras.

The driver has been well tested with H9, H9C and M25C, as well as with the SXV and Exview "piggyback" guiders and the
Lodestar standalone guider, and lightly tested with H16 and H18.  

It has been tested on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 (both 32 and 64 bit versions), and using Images Plus, Nebulosity, PHD
and Maxim DL, and with ASCOM 5.1 and the 6.0 Beta.

Dispite all the testing done by a number of dedicated volunteers, PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF 
THE DRIVER until you have tried it during the daylight first. 

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

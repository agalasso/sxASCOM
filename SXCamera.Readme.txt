This is the README.txt for version 2.1.1.3

This is an UNSTABLE release of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras,
which contains new, untested or lightly tested code and will expire.

There is a STABLE release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

This version adds:
    - support for 674/694 based cameras
    - changes the log destination to use the ASCOM logging subsystem
    - an updated installer that better handles non-English locales

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

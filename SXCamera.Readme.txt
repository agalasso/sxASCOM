This code should be regared as Beta quality. There have been a number of
changes for this release, but most of them involve setup/config.  There
have been very few actual changes to the driver.

I have replaced the setup wizard I wrote with changes to the installer
so that it provides a more seamless experience. The installer now includes
a check to require previous versions to be uninstalled.

This release tries to improve support for interlaced cameras, but I'm unable 
to test it myself because I don't have one.  I do not expect binning or 
subimages to work with interlaced cameras, but there is some chance that 
full frame images will work with this release. If you have one, including
Lodestar, please test it.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until 
you have tried it during the daylight first.

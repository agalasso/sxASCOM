This is the README.txt for version 1.5.6.

This is an UNSTABLE release, of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras.  There is a STABLE release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

It contains fixes for a conform temperature problem, initial support for

the CoStar camera.

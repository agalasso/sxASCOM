This code should be regared as Alpha quality. As the changelog below shows, 
there were almost 500 lines of code added, and another 500 moved around.  
It is very likely that all these changes have broken something.

I have added a setup wizard that will create reasonably named SX entries depending
upon a users equipment.

This release tries to improve support for interlaced cameras, but I'm unable to test 
it myself because I don't have one.  I do not expect binning or subimages to work
with interlaced cameras, but there is some change that full frame images will work
with this release. If you have one, please test it.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until you have
tried it during the daylight first.

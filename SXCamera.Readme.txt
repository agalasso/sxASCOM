Two testers have reported that cooler support seems to be working, so 
it is now avaiable without "Enable Untested" selected

This code should be regared as Alpha quality. As the changelog below shows, 
there were almost 700 likes of code added, and another 1,100 moved around.  
It is very likely that this driver won't work.  

This release adds support for interleaved cameras that I'm unable to test because 
I don't have one. I have told it to treat my M25C as interleaved, and it seemed 
to work but it is probably going to take a few tries to get it right.

It also has prliminary support for multiple USB cameras.  The configure screen needs 
to be made more usable before the driver is done, but the currrent arrangement allows 
you to specify that it should use the first camera it finds, to use a specific camera 
(specified by VID/PID) or to use all but one type of camera (again VID/PID).

The default configuration will allow any camera but a Lodestar as the main camera and
to use only a Lodestar as the second camera. For many users this is the right setup. If you 
have a different camera and need help configuring the driver, please ask.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until you have
tried it during the daylight first.

This is the README.txt for version 2.2

This is an Release Candidate build of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras.
It contains new, untested or lightly tested code and will expire.

There is a PRODUCTION release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

This version adds:
    - Fixed a few pre-release minor issues
    - Add camera data for H18
    - Move H694/H674 from untested to tested
    - support for cameras with shutters, including handling of darks and
      zero length exposures.
    - support for Superstar/H694/H694C
      - updates installer to treat Superstar as a guide camera
    - installer automatically removes previous version if possible
    - interlaced camera (lodestar mostly) banding improvements:
      - symetric binning now reads out as progressive, which
        avoids banding problems entirely
      - an option to make the camera looked like it does not support binning
        while setting a fixed binning mode. This can be used to force a 
        program which does not support binning to bin (PHD is a fine 
        example) so you take advantage of the progressive 
        readout of binned images
      - several options to make banding better for unbinned images
          - take a second exposure for the second frame.  This elminates 
            banding but doubles exposure time.
          - apply a gaussian blur. This is useful for applications
            that try to follow stars
          - equalize odd and even frame brightness.  Because of
            chip issues, this doesn't work as well as you might think it
            would 
    - an option to square lodestar pixels so plate solvers can solve
      the images.  This is done the "easy way" - it expands the pixels
      horizontally but does not increase the apparent size of the sensor,
      so it throws away a few pixels from the right edge. Doing it the 
      "right way" is much harder, and for a guide camera didn't
      seem to be worth it.

what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.

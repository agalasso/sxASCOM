This code seems to be approaching production quality for interlaced
cameras and the SXF guider.  If you have one of the tested progressive 
cameras (M25C/H9/H9C) you should have good luck. 

Full screen, unbinned images with progressive cameras are Alpha quality.

This release tries to improve support for interlaced cameras, but I'm unable 
to test it myself because I don't have one.  In the previous version full screen, 
unbinned interlaced images seemed to work.  This release attempts to get 
the beginnings of binning to work - it is likely that only binning that the
the resolution of the sensor can be divided by will work (i.e. if you want 
to bin by 3, the size of the sensor probably needs to be divisible by 3). 
For lodestar, this means only 2X bining.

If you have an interlaced camera, including Lodestar, please test it.

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS VERSION OF THE DRIVER until 
you have tried it during the daylight first.

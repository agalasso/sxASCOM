This is the README for the ASCOM driver for Starlight Express cameras.

     This driver was not written by, authorized by, sanctioned by, or any
     other ... by Starlight Express.  It was independently developed 
     from the developer documentation available from the SX website. I had
     a couple of email exchanges with Terry Platt, but that is the extent
     of SX involvement.  Please do not make them regret providing 
     developer documentation by asking questions or complaining about 
     problems to SX.

I am moving from DSLR imaging to CCD imaging, and am a professional software 
developer. I discovered that my two favorite imaging apps (PHD and
Images Plus) would not work with my new SX camera.  I also had some truely
lousy weather, and since it was a "simple matter of programming" to make them
work with my camera, so I wrote this driver.

This is an ALPHA release.  That means it isn't ready for prime time.  I'm 
releasing it in the hopes of learning more about how it works with various
SX cameras and guiders. Please test it during daylight hours.  

PLEASE DO NOT RISK A GOOD IMAGING NIGHT ON THIS DRIVER. 

I have am SXVF-M25C and the older style 8 bit guide camera.  It seems to work 
with both of them. If you are willing to participate by loading the driver, and 
seeing if it works with your camera and guider (if you have one), I'd 
like to know the results. If it doesn't work, it can create a log file 
which might help me fix it.

Expected To Work:
- SXVF-MX25C
- SX 8-bit Guide Camera
- Simultanious use of both cameras by seperate software products
- Autoguider port - if a guide camera is attached, the guide port shows up
  as attached to it.  If not, it is attached to the main camera.

Will probably work:
- other SX cameras
- SX 16 bit guide camera

Known Limitations/things that don't work:

- Binning does not yet work
- There is no support for SXVR cooler features since I don't have a camera
  which provides these features, and because there is no documentation for 
  those features on the SX website
- serial ports - I don't have the serial box, and if I did it would require 
  writing virtual serial drivers for my telescope to take advantage of them

Disclaimer:

At present I have no business model, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with
the driver.  This Alpha release is in no way a commitment that there will ever
be another release, and if you submit a defect report, there is not guarantee
that I will ever fix it.  

If I get the driver working well enough that I can use it for my imaging
needs, any other work I do on it will be taking time away from some other part
of my life.  I'm a hobbiest, and I'd rather be imaging than writing 
software. Supporting cameras that I don't own and can't test on will be a 
non-trivial undertaking (for example, putting together the installer took 
more than an hour).  I'm likely (but not promising to) release the 
driver for free, and to request donations to fund support.  

If you have an SX camera then you have invested in a premium setup, and this 
driver will provide you with additional software options. If you don't think 
that is worth anything, then don't donate - just don't have any 
expectation that problems you report will be fixed.

Clear Skies,
